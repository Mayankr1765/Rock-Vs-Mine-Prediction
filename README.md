# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
Machine Learning Project for Predicting Whether Object is Rock or Mines

We have collected sonar data . Metals have been placed inside the dataset sample as mines are metal. 
Sonar signals whether it's metal or rock.

After collection of data, we pre-processed the data with numpy and pandas library.
Data is split into training and test data. 90% of the data we used as training data, and 10% for test data.

We have used the Logistic Regression model as it is a binary classification.
